The Administrator’s Web Page was designed to be user friendly and straight forward.  
It allows the user to navigate through a web browser to add/edit/delete database entries without 
ever having to run SQL statements directly to the database. 
The design allows the user to switch between pages with one click of a button.  
This is done by having a taskbar located at the top of the web page. 
When a user searches a food or chooses to add a food, the nutritional information is 
displayed in a textbox with a corresponding title to its left.  
The food items are displayed in this manner because there are just too many items per 
food and too many food items to display them in a table.  
If a table was the route chosen to display the food data, the user would have to scroll left to right as well as 
up and down to view everything.  The restaurants, however, are displayed within a table.  
It was easier to do this for the restaurant as there are not as many items in the database.  
The design will consist of six main pages (located on taskbar): 
a search page, Add food page, Restaurants page, a Food of the day page, a page to view the information of users for 
UK Food Service research  and a Login/Logout page.  

Each will have sub pages such as search results, successful add pages, successful restaurant add/delete, etc. which 
display the outcomes of the database insertions/edit/deletes.  
There are also features that return error messages to the user when add/deletes/edits do not work.  
These error messages are very helpful and allow the user to precisely determine what is wrong with their request.
